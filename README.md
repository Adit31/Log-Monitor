Log Monitoring Application

Log monitoring system provides a solution for log analysis, and reporting. It gives us the means to act with speed as soon as possible when threats, errors, or oversights are detected. This feature is an essential cornerstone of IT security. This application provides means for advanced search options for quick locating and sorting of pertinent data. The collection of logs from multiple sources, which can be unified into a single universal log resource can further be used for trend analysis by data scientists to predict future system failures before they occur. Easier creation of more comprehensive troubleshooting methods and helping to differentiate between common false positives and actual bugs and similar problems can be very useful to analyze and report the data properly.
